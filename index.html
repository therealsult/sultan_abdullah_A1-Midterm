    <p>Lg is the best electronics company in the world. I personaly used to own LG cellphones for a long time. I stared with the LG G4 in 2015 and used stuck with their phones till now. I still own an LG V40, I have owned a total of 5 LG cellpohones in my lifetime. Because of my experience with LG, I think they are the best company in the world</p>

    <p>I personaly think that LG is a great company that were way underrated in the cellphone market. They always provided quality phones that last years without any issues at all. I still have my original LG G4 at home and I still use it from time to time to compare the camera quality.</p>

    <p>Samsung is better than LG or any other technology manufacturer in the world. I like Samsung because they are always ahead of all other companies when it comes to new tech. They will alwasy be my favorite company when it comes to technology manufacturers</p>
